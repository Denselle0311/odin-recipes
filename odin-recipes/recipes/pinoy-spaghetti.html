    <h1>Pinoy Spaghetti Recipe</h1>
    <p>
        Pinoy Spaghetti is always present on our table during Christmas dinner because my only son, Dave, loves it. I used to cook this for him when he was younger, but now he is capable of making his favorite Filipino spaghetti anytime he wants. I am blessed with good kids that share the same passion in Pinoy Spaghetti is always present on our table during Christmas dinner because my only son, Dave, loves it. <br> I used to cook this for him when he was younger, but now he is capable of making his favorite Filipino spaghetti anytime he wants.

            Our family’s version of Pinoy Spaghetti for the holidays involves three types of meat: ground pork, ham, and red hotdog (red hotdogs are always available in the Philippines, but it is not common here in the US). We make it as Filipino as we can, just like how I remember it back then when we are still living in the Philippines. I gave this recipe a special touch by adding red and green bell peppers. It makes the sauce look appetizing while adding a sweet and kinda fruity flavor.</p>

            Every year, each member of the family helps me cook their favorite food. This does not exempt my two little girls, Danika and Danielle, who always help me prepare and cook Lumpiang Shanghai for Noche Buena.</p>
