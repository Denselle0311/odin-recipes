        <h1>Filipino Chicken Adobo Recipe</h1>

        <p>
            Chicken Adobo is an authentic Filipino dish and is one of the mostly recognized  Filipino foods. Not to be mistaken with Mexican adobo, this dish is uniquely prepared by stewing chicken in vinegar and soy sauce.
        </p>

        <p>
            Several sources who are experts in Asian food history say that the Filipinos were already cooking adobo even before Spanish colonization. According to them, cooking with vinegar preserves the meat. This method is also considered as one of the earliest food preservation practice.

        <p>
            Chicken Adobo is a type of Filipino chicken stew. Chicken pieces are marinated in soy sauce and spices, pan-fried, and stewed until tender. The dish gained popularity because of its delicious taste and ease in preparation.

        <h2>How to Cook Chicken Adobo</h2>

        <p>
            Cooking Chicken Adobo is quick and simple. This recipe suggests marinating the chicken to make it more flavorful. It is the best way to go if you want to experience authentic Filipino chicken adobo. If you are in a hurry, feel free to skip this step, but make sure to simmer the chicken longer than 30 minutes to better extract the flavors from it.
        </p>
        <p>
            Start by marinating the chicken in soy sauce and garlic. The garlic needs to be crushed for best results. This process takes 1 hour to 12 hours depending on how flavorful you want the dish to be. Sometimes marinating for an hour is not enough. I think that 3 hours is optimal. The chicken absorbs most of the flavors from the soy sauce and garlic during this step. It is noticeable when you taste the dish after cooking. Note that it is also possible to include the vinegar in this step.

            Pour marinade into the pot and add water. Let boil. The bay leaves and whole peppercorn can now be added. The process takes 20 to 25 minutes depending on the quality of the chicken. However, feel free to cook longer in low heat for a super tender chicken adobo.
        </p>
        <p>
            Add the vinegar. This can also be added as a part of the marinade. Let it cook for 10 minutes and then add sugar and salt. I only add salt if needed. It is important to taste your dish before adding seasonings.
        </p>
        <p>
            Filipino chicken adobo can be served with or without sauce. If you like it very tasty then continue to cook on an uncovered cooking pot until the liquid completely evaporates.

                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Chicken: slice the chicken into serving pieces before cooking. The cuts are usually smaller. For example, a regular piece of chicken breast can be divided into 2 to 3 pieces depending on your preference.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Bay leaves: This is an essential ingredient for Filipino adobo as far as I am concerned. Dried bay leaves (locally called “dahon ng laurel”) are usually used because of it is available year round. It can also be stored longer in room temperature. However, fresh bay leaves can also be utilized for this recipe.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Soy sauce: I personally prefer Filipino brand soy sauce in making adobo. I have nothing against Kikkoman and other Asian brands, but the dish will taste more authentic if local soy sauce is used.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Vinegar: White vinegar is the most common type to use for adobo. Sometimes I use cane or rice vinegar too. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Garlic: Adobo should be garlicy. The garlic can be sauteed and boiled just like in this recipe, or it can be toasted. I toast this by browning the crushed garlic in oil before adding the chicken. Sometimes I make extra toasted garlic so that I have more for garnish later on.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Sugar: this is an optional ingredient. Sugar is added to balance the saltiness of the dish. You can add more too if you want your chicken adobo to be on the sweet side.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Salt: This is optional because the soy sauce is already salty to begin with. I only add salt when needed, which is not usual.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Peppercorn: It does not matter if it is is whole, crushed, or ground. Whole peppercorn has just been used traditionally.  
                        </li>
